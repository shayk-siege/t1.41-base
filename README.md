# t1.41-base
Tribes 1.41 Base

Hello. This repository is for edits to the base mod that has been included with the various versions of Tribes 1.4x floating around the net. I will focus on correcting some issues that were created when base was being re-organized for the 1.4x versions of Tribes, but will also commit to some improvements over the original base mod that was part of the 1.11 installation, as well.

These updates will be made available through this repository as soon as I'm able to get them tested and uploaded.

The most up-to-date version of the mod will also be ran on the SIEGE Tribes server, which will be public and available for anyone to join and play/test the mod out as they wish.
