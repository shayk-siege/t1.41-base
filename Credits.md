The following are credits given for any work referred to or directly used in this project.

1. Dynamix and everyone who was part of it for the base mod that this was created from within Tribes from eons ago.
2. GarageGames for the 1.4x updated Tribes and the re-organized base mod that this project is directly spawned from.


I will do my best to credit everyone whose work I use for this project here. If anyone feels that their work was used without being credited, contact me within the SIEGE forums at https://siege.flarum.cloud/ and let me know and I will look into it. Note that just because you may have done something similar to, or even virtually identical to, something that is used in this project, it does not mean that it was taken from your work. Again, I'll be happy to discuss it and determine if credit is due and update my list here accordingly.

Thanks.
Shayk
